## How It Works

This application is a modern stopwatch built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It functions as a PWA, allowing it to be installed on various devices for a native app-like experience. The app leverages service workers to cache assets, enabling it to work offline. It also uses the Screen Wake Lock API to prevent the screen from turning off while the stopwatch is running and `localStorage` to save lap times.

## Features

- **Start, Stop, and Reset:** Basic stopwatch controls.
- **Lap History:** Record and view lap times with timestamps.
- **Offline Functionality:** Works even without an internet connection.
- **Screen Wake Lock:** Keeps the screen on while the stopwatch is active.
- **Cross-Platform:** Installable on desktop and mobile devices.
